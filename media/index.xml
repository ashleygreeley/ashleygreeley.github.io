      <description>On April 3, 2024, I spoke with 9 different local news stations around the country about the eclipse, eclipse safety, and how to get involved with citizen science projects with NASA! You too can learn more at go.nasa.gov/Eclipse2024. The contiguous US will be in a good location to see at least a partial eclipse, with 31 million people already living along the path of totality.

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Be stubborn, both in pursuing research and finding the right opportunity. I honestly believe the most important characteristic of a scientist is stubbornly trucking along no matter what (followed closely by the ability to change their mind when confronted with new evidence).&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Read the article on NASA&amp;rsquo;s website here!</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;One study, led by NASA heliophysicist Ashley Greeley as part of her doctoral thesis, used two decades of data from SAMPEX to show that the SAA is slowly but steadily drifting in a northwesterly direction. The results helped confirm models created from geomagnetic measurements and showed how the SAA&amp;rsquo;s location changes as the geomagnetic field evolves.&amp;rdquo;&amp;quot;&#xA;Read the article on Science Daily here!</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;But sometimes a satellite is just unlucky. Ashley Greeley, a postdoctoral scholar at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, recalled a CubeSat that died shortly after launch. During start-up checks and the commissioning phase, “we think that an energetic particle hit it in the wrong place at the wrong time, and we never got data, unfortunately,” she said.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Read the article on EOS here! </description>
