      <description>&amp;ldquo;Engineer Allison Evans and graduate student scientist Ashley [Greeley] dress in &amp;lsquo;bunny suits&amp;rsquo; for their work to install particle detectors on a CubeSat instrument. The Compact Radiation Belt Explorer (CeREs) will study the bands of energetic particles that surround Earth, known as the Van Allen radiation belts.&amp;rdquo;

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Be stubborn, both in pursuing research and finding the right opportunity. I honestly believe the most important characteristic of a scientist is stubbornly trucking along no matter what (followed closely by the ability to change their mind when confronted with new evidence).&amp;rdquo;

      <description>&amp;ldquo;One study, led by NASA heliophysicist Ashley Greeley as part of her doctoral thesis, used two decades of data from SAMPEX to show that the SAA is slowly but steadily drifting in a northwesterly direction. The results helped confirm models created from geomagnetic measurements and showed how the SAA&amp;rsquo;s location changes as the geomagnetic field evolves.&amp;rdquo;&amp;quot;

      <description>&amp;ldquo;But sometimes a satellite is just unlucky. Ashley Greeley, a postdoctoral scholar at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, recalled a CubeSat that died shortly after launch. During start-up checks and the commissioning phase, “we think that an energetic particle hit it in the wrong place at the wrong time, and we never got data, unfortunately,” she said.&amp;rdquo;
